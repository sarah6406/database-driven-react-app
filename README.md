// DATABASE-DRIVEN REACT APP

I found this project the most challenging so far, utilising a database on an external platform (Supabase), creating an interface with different components using React, an populating the external database using PostGresSQL.
I don't feel I was confident enough with any of these aspects to complete the project with ease, but has certainly been a learning curve! I had big ideas as to what I wanted to achieve but was short of time - I feel requirements have been met, with a lot of help from peers.
However, a user is able to create new posts which are then added to a different page - these posts can then be seen on the page when the user navigates to the relevant page. A category is also able to be assigned to these posts. The categories can be filtered so that messages of a certain hard-coded category can be seen.
I still need to gain more of an understanding of SQL, but I think I have understood the concept of components in React fairly well.
